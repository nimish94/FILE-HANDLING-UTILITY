## Company  
**CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD**

## Intern Details  
**Name:** Nimish Sadhu  
**Intern ID:** CT08DK421  
**Domain:** Java Programming  
**Batch Duration:** April 20th, 2025 – June 20th, 2025  
**Mentor:** Neela Santhosh Kumar  

## Internship Task 1 – File Handling Utility (Java)

### About the Task  
This project was completed as part of my Java development internship. It focuses on implementing core file handling operations using Java. The goal was to build a simple command-line utility that allows users to perform basic file operations such as writing content to a file, reading from a file, and appending content to an existing file. The program offers a basic menu-based interface prompting users to select their desired operation and enter the necessary input.

This task helped me gain a solid understanding of Java file I/O using classes like `FileWriter`, `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, along with proper exception handling. I learned how to safely interact with files locally, manage text content, and structure user-friendly, error-resilient Java programs.

### Tools & Resources Used  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA — Provided syntax highlighting, error detection, and an integrated terminal for compiling and running Java programs.  
- **ChatGPT:** Assisted in program structure, understanding file handling methods, writing clean and documented code, and clarifying conceptual doubts.  
- **Google Search:** Used extensively to consult official Java docs, troubleshoot exceptions, and find code examples from platforms like GeeksforGeeks and Stack Overflow.  
- **YouTube:** Watched tutorials from Telusko, CodeWithHarry, and freeCodeCamp to reinforce concepts of file handling and Java fundamentals.  

### Features Implemented  
- **Write to a File:** Overwrites existing files or creates new files with user-provided content.  
- **Read from a File:** Displays file contents line-by-line on the console.  
- **Modify a File:** Appends new content without overwriting existing data.  
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully manages exceptions such as `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException` to prevent crashes.  

### How It Works  
Upon running the program, the user:  
1. Enters the file name (e.g., `data.txt`).  
2. Selects an operation from the menu:  
   - `1` for Write  
   - `2` for Read  
   - `3` for Append  
3. Provides the text input when prompted.  

The program executes the chosen operation and confirms success, providing a simple and intuitive experience for beginners.

### Real-World Applications  
Although simple, this utility is relevant for:  
- Creating log files for applications  
- Saving user inputs or configuration data  
- Developing data import/export tools  
- Automating text file processing  
- Building basic text-based databases or records  

It also lays a foundation for advanced topics like serialization, streaming, file encryption, and working with CSV or JSON in Java.

### Conclusion  
This internship task strengthened my knowledge of Java’s file handling capabilities while emphasizing clean code and user interaction. It provided practical experience with Java’s standard I/O libraries and improved my debugging, exception handling, and file manipulation skills.

The project was developed using IntelliJ IDEA and supported by online resources including Google, ChatGPT, and YouTube. This task marks a meaningful step toward becoming a proficient backend and full-stack Java developer.
