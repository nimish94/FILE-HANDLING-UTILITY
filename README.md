## üìù Internship Task 1 ‚Äì File Handling Utility (Java)

### üìå About the Task

This project was completed as part of my Java development internship and focuses on implementing core **file handling** operations using the Java programming language. The objective was to create a simple command-line utility for performing essential file operations such as:

- Writing content to a file  
- Reading from a file  
- Modifying (appending to) the contents of an existing file  

The program features a basic menu-driven interface that prompts users to select an operation and input necessary details.

The task emphasized understanding Java‚Äôs file I/O (Input/Output) mechanisms through the use of:

- `FileWriter`
- `FileReader`
- `BufferedReader`
- Exception handling (`try-catch` blocks)

This hands-on project enhanced my ability to work with files in Java, manage text content, and design user-friendly, error-resilient applications.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Resources Used

- **IntelliJ IDEA** ‚Äì Primary IDE used for development. It provided helpful features such as syntax highlighting, error detection, and an integrated terminal.  
- **ChatGPT** ‚Äì Assisted with code structuring, Java file I/O concepts, documentation, and debugging tips.  
- **Google Search** ‚Äì Used for accessing Java documentation and community forums like Stack Overflow.  
- **YouTube** ‚Äì Tutorials from Telusko, CodeWithHarry, and freeCodeCamp helped reinforce Java fundamentals.

### üöÄ Features Implemented

- **Write to a File**  
  Overwrites an existing file or creates a new one with user-provided content.

- **Read from a File**  
  Displays file contents line-by-line on the console.

- **Modify a File**  
  Appends user input to the existing content without overwriting.

- **Error Handling**  
  Gracefully handles exceptions such as `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException` to ensure stability.

### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a **file name** (e.g., `data.txt`).  
2. A menu is displayed for operation selection:
   - `1` ‚Äì Write  
   - `2` ‚Äì Read  
   - `3` ‚Äì Append  
3. Based on the selection, the program:
   - Accepts input (for write/append)
   - Reads and displays contents (for read)
4. Confirms successful completion of the operation.

The program is user-friendly, menu-driven, and ideal for beginners.

### üåç Real-World Applications

Though simple, this **file handling** tool has practical relevance, including:

- Logging application events  
- Storing configuration or user input  
- Automating data processing tasks  
- Basic data export/import  
- Maintaining text-based records or logs

It lays the groundwork for more advanced topics like file serialization, working with CSV/JSON, and secure file operations.

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

This internship task strengthened my understanding of Java‚Äôs **file handling** features and helped me apply best practices in coding, debugging, and user interaction. It was developed using IntelliJ IDEA and supported by research from ChatGPT, Google, and YouTube.

The project is a foundational step toward becoming a proficient Java backend or full-stack developer.
